# Forest Admin in Rails [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ForestAdmin/forest-rails.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ForestAdmin/forest-rails)

Forest is a modern Admin Interface (see the [live
demo](https://app.forestadmin.com/login?livedemo)) that works on all major web
frameworks including Rails.

The main difference between *forest_liana* and gems like *Administrate*, *Active Admin*
or *Rails Admin* is that *forest_liana* creates a Rails Engine that automatically
generates a highly flexible admin REST API and deploys a WYSIWYG interface to <a
href="https://www.forestadmin.com/">Forest Admin</a>.
